<lg><speaker>I</speaker> met a traveller from an antique land,</lg>
<lg>Who said — <speaker/>“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</lg>
<lg>Stand in the desart.... Near them, on the sand,</lg>
<lg>Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</lg>
<lg>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</lg>
<lg>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</lg>
<lg>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</lg>
<lg>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;</lg>
<lg>And on the pedestal, these words appear:</lg>
<lg>My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings,</lg>
<lg>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and de<lg>spair!</lg>
</lg>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
<lg>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare</lg>
<lg>The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<speaker/></lg>
