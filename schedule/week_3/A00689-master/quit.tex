\section*{To the right worshipfull Sir Humfrey Gilbert {\itshape Knight.}}\par
THere came to my hands of late (right vvoorshipfull) a notable peece of vvoorke, of the Portes, and of diuers rare things bothe of the Easte and VVeast {\itshape Indians,} vvritten by {\itshape Martin Fer­nandes Denciso,} aboute {\itshape Anno.} 1518. then Dedicated to {\itshape Don Charles} King of {\itshape Castile,} and after called in aboute tvventie yeares past, for that it reuealed secretes that the Spanish natiō vvas loth to haue knovven to the vvorlde. And finding in the same vvorke the Lon­gitudes and Altitudes of many Ilandes, and of the Portes of the tracte of the firme lande of {\itshape America,} I thought good to trāslate out of Spanish into English some parte of the same Calling to minde, that your vvorship vvas the firste man of our nation that gaue light to our people for the finding out of the north­vvest straight, and that novv you meane in proper person, and that at your ovvne charges, to take some noble voyage and discouerie in hande, to leaue be­hind you renovvne to your family, and honour and profite to your countrie: I coulde not but honour you in harte. And to make some shevv of my good vvill, I desired much to present some thing to you, and vvas sory that I had no notable vvorke of mat­ter of Nauigation to Dedicate vnto you, meete for your so greate vvorthinesse. But yet such as this is, I dedicate it vnto you, besechyng you most hum­bly % image:http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5891&page=3
 to take the same in good parte, and to vvay the good vvill of the giuer, as very greate persons of highe honour haue done, vvhen little trifels haue bene giuen them by others of lovv degree. And Sir, albeit this small gifte (in respect of ministring any knovvledge to you your self) may seeme nothing, in that you doe vnderstande the tongues, vvherein this and many other knovvledges of high value, lie hid from our Seamen, although not from you: yet this may for our meere English Seamen, Pilotes, Marri­ners, \&c. not acquaynted vvith forrayne tongues, bring greate pleasure (if it fortune our Mariners or any other of our Nation, to be driuen by vvinde, tempeste, currents, or by other chaunce to any of the Ilandes, Portes, Hauens, Bayes or Forelandes mencioned in this Pamphlet,) and so it may also in the voyage, be a meane to keepe them the more frō idlenesse, the Nurce of villany, and to giue them also right good occasion by vvay of example, vpon any nevv Discouerie, to take the Altitude and La­titude, to set dovvne the tracte of the Ilandes, the natures of the soyles, and to note the qualitie of the ayre, the seuerall benefites that the Soyles and the Riuers yeelde, vvith all the discomodities and vvantes that the same places haue, and if our Coun­trie men fortune the rather to be avvaked out of their heauy sleepe vvherein they haue long lien, and the rather hereby be occasioned to shunne be­stiall ignoraunce, and vvith other nations rather late than neuer to make thēselues shine vvith the bright­nesse of knovvledge, let them giue Sir {\itshape Humfrey Gilbert} the thankes, for vvhose sake I translated the same. % image:http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5891&page=3
 And thus committing your vvorship to the greate Neptune, the greate God of the Christians that ru­leth lande and Sea, I leaue you to your voyage, and to the gouernment of that mightie God, vvho ne­uer plāted in any man so hie courage, vvith so much desire to greate attempts, but to some greate end, as heretofore in many hath bene seene, and as the se­quele in your happie successes no doubt shall be founde, as England and the vvhole vvorld shall out of question vvit­nesse. From London the xiiij. of May. 1578.

FRom the Ilande called {\itshape Fierro,} vnto the Ilande of saint Nicholas, are twoo hun­dreth leagues: the Iland of saint Nicholas lieth South Southweast, and from thence to the Ilande called {\itshape Fuego} are .xl. leagues: that Iland lieth directly South, and from thence to the Cape of S. Iustin, whiche standeth in the o­ther side of the Equinoctiall line, are foure hundred leagues. The cape of S. Austin lieth South Southweast, with the 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{The cape of saynt Austin.} Iland called {\itshape Fuego,} \& standeth in eight degrees on the other side of the Equinoctiall towardes the South: and from the Cape of S. Austin vnto the gulfe \& riuer of S. Francis are 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{The riuer of saynt Francis.} fortie fiue leagues, the coast lieth southweast: the riuer of saint Francis standeth in ten degrees towardes the south: this is a good porte \& it hath a good riuer. From that riuer vnto the 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{The Bay.} Bay of all Sayntes are seuentie leagues: the Baye lieth Southwest, \& by south, in .xiij. degrees, and there remayneth in the middest porte Roiall, whiche is a good porte, and hath good riuers. The Bay of al Saints hath within it certain litle Ilandes, and within these are twoo good riuers. In the dire­ction towardes the coast, the lande lieth lowe, and the people are naked, \& eate bread of rootes. It is a baren countrie. From the Bay of all Saintes to the porte called {\itshape Seguro} are .lxxx. leagues, the coast lying south \& by weast. Porte {\itshape Seguro} stan­deth .m. xvij. degrees, this is a porte and a Riuer, and it is a good porte. From porte {\itshape Seguro} vnto the cape which is beyond {\itshape Golfo Formoso,} that is to say, the fayre gulfe, are one hundreth and ten leagues, and the coast lieth south southweast: and be­tweene these twoo are many dry and shallowe places, whiche % image:http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5891&page=5
 lieth on sea borde .xx. and .xxx. leagues: and passing them, you shall finde neare the land barres, and sholdes, which haue vpō them three or foure fadome water of deapth, and neare to­wardes the ende of the sholdes, standeth the gulfe of Saint {\itshape Thome,} whereunto adioyneth the gulfe of {\itshape Barrosas.} 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Saynt Thome.}\par
And passing those shallow places, there lieth cape {\itshape Formoso,} that is to say, the fayre cape, in .xxij. degrees and a halfe: and beyng paste the fayre cape, there appeareth a gulfe betweene two landes, and it seemeth to haue a league in breadth, and three or foure in length: and at the ende therof is the riuer cal­led {\itshape Delgado,} this is a good porte, a good coūtrie, and good peo­ple, although that they be naked. From this gulfe to Cape {\itshape Frio,} that is to say, the colde cape, are .xvj. leagues: cape {\itshape Frio} standeth in .xxiij. degrees and a halfe, this cape hath before it an Iland adioyning, and the fayre cape an other, \& betwene these other little Ilands. From the colde Cape the coast doth turne to the Northweast and by North .xxv. leagues, \& from thence it turneth Northeast other .xx. leagues, and maketh the Colde cape lyke to an Iland: and betweene him and the lande there is a good gulfe, with many small Ilandes in the 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Cold Cape.} middest: and frō this gulfe vnto the gulfe of the {\itshape Mangues} are xx. leagues. That of the {\itshape Mangues} hath two Ilands at the end of it, and it is great, \& hath .xx. leagues at the mouth. From this gulf vnto the riuer of S. Francis are .lxxv. leagues. And that of saint Francis lieth Southweast in .xxv. degrees, and before that of saynt Francis lieth the riuer of the {\itshape Cananca,} whiche is a good riuer, and in the middest of this coast lieth the cape of saint Sebastian, which entreth foure leagues into the sea, and towardes the Easte parte of it, standeth the porte of 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Saynt Se­bastian.} {\itshape Gregorio:} and to the weast parte lieth the porte of {\itshape Terrerias,} which is a good gulfe, and bath an Iland in the middest. All this coast hath many litle Ilands before it. From the porte of saynt Francis vnto the riuer {\itshape Delas Bueltas,} that is to say, the croked riuer, are .lx. leagues, the coast lieth South, the croked riuer standeth in .xxix. degrees, and neare to the riuer of saynt % image:http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5891&page=5
 Francis toward the land lieth an Iland, which hath in lēgth xxv. leagues, and towarde the lande he seemeth in circle ob­lique: and rounde aboute the same is the Sea, and hath [...] {\gap 〈◊〉} leagues in breadth: and towardes the [...] {\gap ••}rme lande lieth the gulfe and riuer called {\itshape Reparo,} and the riuer of {\itshape Bayadas.} From the crooked riuer vnto the Cape saint Mary are .lxxx. leagues. The cape saynt Mary standeth in .xxxv. degrees, and a little past this cape, entreth in a riuer more than twentie leagues of breadth, where be people that do eate mans flesh. This coast is al full of sholdes. And before cape saynt Mary are certaine small Ilandes. In all these coastes from cape saynt Mary vnto cape saint Austin groweth muche Brasill and little o­ther thing of any profite in it.\par
And seing that we haue spoken of the coast that lieth from the cape of saynt Austin towardes the pole Antartike: let vs returne to speake of that whiche is towardes the parte of the pole Artike, whiche is called the North pole. I say that from the cape of saynt Austin vnto the riuer {\itshape Marauon} are three hundreth leagues: {\itshape Marauon} lieth weast, in seuen de­grees 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Marauon.} and a halfe, it is a greate riuer, and hath more than .xv. leagues in breadth, and ryght leagues within the land. It hath many Ilandes, and in this riuer within the lande .xl. leagues, there is neare to the sayd riuer a Mountaine, where­vpon groweth trees of Incense, the trees be of a good height, \& the bowes be like to Plum trees, \& the Incense doth hang at them, as the yet doth at the tyles of a house in the winter season when it dothe freese. In this riuer were taken foure {\itshape In­dians} in a small boate called in the {\itshape Indian} language a {\itshape Canoa,} that came downe by the riuer, and there was takē from them two stones of Emeralds, the one of them being as great as a mans hand▪ They sayde that so many dayes iourney goyng vpwarde by the riuer, they founde a rocke of that stone.

 from the cape of saynt Austin vnto {\itshape Maranon} is a cleare coast and deepe, but neare to the riuer are certaine sholdes towards the East parte. And by the weast part the riuer is deepe, and it hath a good entrie. From this riuer {\itshape Maranon,} vnto the ri­uer whiche is called the Sea of fresh water, art .xxv. leagues: 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{The Sea of freshe vvater.} this riuer hath .lx. leagues of breadth at the mouth, and carieth suche great aboundance of water, that it entereth more than xx. leagues into the Sea, and mingleth not it selfe with the salte water: this breadth goeth .xxv. leagues within the land, and after it is deuided into partes, the one going towards the southeast, and the other towardes the southwest. That which goeth towards the southweast is very deepe and of much wa­ter, and hath a chanell half a league of breadth, that a Carrake may goe vp through it: and the tydes be so swifte, that the shippes haue neede of good cabels. The ryuer of this porte is very good, and there haue bene some that haue entered fiftie leagues within it, and haue seene no Mountaynes. The {\itshape In­dians} of this countrey haue their lippes made full of small holes in foure partes, and through those holes be put small rings, and likewise at their eares: and if any man aske of thē where they had their golde, they answere, that goyng vp by the riuer so many dayes iourney, they found certaine moun­taynes that had much of it, and from those mountaynes they brought it when they would haue it, but they made no great accōpt of it, for they neither buy nor sell, and amongst them is nothing but chaunge. In this countrey they eate bread of rootes, and {\itshape Maiz,} and they eate certaine rootes whiche they call {\itshape Aies} and {\itshape Batatas,} but the {\itshape Batatas} be better than the other rootes, and beyng rawe they haue a smell of Chestnuts: they are to be eatē rosted. These {\itshape Indians} do make wine of y\textsuperscript{e} fruite of Date trees, which fruite is yellow in colour, \& is as great as a litle Doues egge, and being in season is good to be eaten, and of him proceedeth good wine, and is preserued for a long time. These kinde of people doe make their houses with vp­per rowmes, and they sleepe in them, as also all their habi­tation % image:http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5891&page=6
 is in the vpper rowmes, and that whiche is alowe, they leaue it open: and also they vse certayne mantels of cotton wooll, and these they tie at the endes with ropes, and the one ende of the rope they make fast to one parte of the house, and the other ende to the other parte of the house: and in these they lie, and be their beddes, and these kinde of beddes be vsed in all the Occidentall {\itshape India,} and there is not in any parte of {\itshape India} any chambers that the people do vse to lodge in aloft from the ground, nor they make any high rowmes, but onely in this parte of {\itshape India,} and in all other places they make their houses without any loftes or chambers, and they couer their houses with the leaues of Date trees, and of grasse. And from this fresh water Sea vnto {\itshape Paria,} the coast lieth weast northweast, and all full of sholdes that the shippes can not come neare to the land. There is from this riuer to {\itshape Paria} twoo hundreth and fiftie leagues. In this freshe water sea, the tydes doe ebbe and flowe as much as they do in Brytayne, and standeth in sixe degrees and halfe. {\itshape Paria} standeth on the other side of the Equinoctiall towarde the North, in seuen degrees: In {\itshape Paria} 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Paria.} the sea floweth but little, and from {\itshape Paria} towardes the weast the sea dothe not flowe. From the entery of the gulfe of {\itshape Pa­ria} vnto the cape that litth towardes the weast, are thirtie fiue leagues, \& from thence the coast turneth towardes the north­east, other .xxxv. leagues, and from thence the coast turneth towardes the weast.

 whiche are of a fadom in length, made of reedes, which grow in that countrie, and at the ende of them is artificially wyned a peece of wood very strong, vnto the whiche peece of woodde at the ende of it, they put a bone of a fish, in place of an arrow head: these kinde of bones be harder than Diamōdes and euery one of them be three or foure fingers long, and they are taken out of a fish that hath three of these bones, one vpon the backe, and one vnder euery wing: but that which grow­eth vpon the backe is the strongest and the greatest. In this Iland the people sayeth that there groweth golde, and in this Ilande and in {\itshape Paria} groweth reedes so great, that they make staues of thē, and carry of them into Spayne. Likewise there be Popingayes very great and gentle, and some of them haue their foreheades yellowe, and this sorte doe quickly learne to speake, and speake muche. There be likewise in the gulfe of {\itshape Paria} pearles, although not many, but very good and greate. {\itshape Paria} hath many Ilandes towardes the north parte of it, vn­till you come to the Iland of saint {\itshape Christopher,} and frō saint {\itshape Christopher,} to the Iland called {\itshape Espanola,} be other Ilands that lieth towards the Northeast. The names of these Ilands are as foloweth: The firste and nearest Ilande to {\itshape Paria} is cal­led the Iland of {\itshape Mayo,} this is but a small Ilande: there is a fruyte growing in it that the caske of it smelleth like to Ben­iamyn:

In all these Ilandes they say there is golde: in that of {\itshape Gwadalupe} hath bene golde found and gathered, but by reason they be not in subiection, there is no certaintie of it. The Iland of saynt {\itshape Iohn} is a good Iland, and

      \marginnote{Saynt Iohn.} it hath two good portes: one of them standeth towardes the north, whiche is called porte {\itshape Rico,} and the towne that is in it is of Christians, and it is a good towne, although that it is not great: and the other is called saynt {\itshape German,} in this I­land is gathered much golde, and all is fine golde: this Iland is xxx. leagues long and lieth East \& Weast, and in breadth twentie. From this Ilande to the Ilande called {\itshape Espanola} are xvj. leagues, and the Ilande called the {\itshape Mona,} standeth well neare in the middest betweene bothe, whiche is a little Iland.

From the {\itshape Beata} to {\itshape Yaquimo} are fiue and twentie leagues. From {\itshape Yaquimo} to the {\itshape Cauana} are fourtie leagues. {\itshape Yaquimo} and the {\itshape Cauana} lieth in twentie degrees. From the {\itshape Cauana} lieth out a cape from the lande into the Sea towardes the South, cyght leagues, and from thence the coast turneth Weast Northweast vnto cape {\itshape Tiburon.} There is from one cape to the other .xxv. leagues.

From the cape of {\itshape Tiburon} the coast turneth towardes the East vnto {\itshape Yaragua} three score and ten leagues, vntill it come neare to the Iland of {\itshape Guanabon.} In this three score and tenne leagues the Iland called {\itshape Espanola} hath not in breadth more than twentie or two and twentie leagues. From {\itshape Yaragua} the coast turneth towardes the Northweast and by North, vnto the cape of saynt {\itshape Nicholas.} There is from {\itshape Yaragua} to the cape of saynt {\itshape Nicholas} fiftie and fiue leagues, and the cape of saint {\itshape Nicholas} beyng doubled, the coast turneth towardes the east vnto porte Roiall: and from the cape of saint {\itshape Nicholas} to port Roiall be fifty leagues. This porte Roiall is the best porte of the Ilande sauyng that it is out of the way of all trade, and therefore they go not to it. From porte Roiall to the porte of {\itshape Plata,} are fiue and thirtie leagues: from the porte of {\itshape Plata} to the Cape {\itshape de Cierpe,} are fourtie leagues: the coaste lieth East Southeast. From the Cape of {\itshape Cierpe} vnto the cape of {\itshape Hi­guei} are eight and twentie leagues.

 South parte of it standeth in .xix. and .xx. degrees: the North parte in .xxiiij. This Ilād is inhabited with Christiās. There is gathered in it much gold: there cōmeth euery yeare frō this Iland to {\itshape Castile,} 400000. {\itshape Castellanos} \& more, euery {\itshape Castellano} is worth .vij. shillings of our money of Englād. It is a coun­trie of much fleshe, and also of much freshe fishe: the cattayle do multiply much, bycause there is no kinde of vermine that do hurt them. In al this Iland the Kine and Mares do bring forth yong ones, once euery yeare, and the yong Mares and 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{The man­ners of the Ilande cal­led Espa­nola.} yong Kine be with fole when they be but a yeare and a halfe olde. The grasse is alwayes greene and neuer waxeth drye: the trees be alwayes greene, with their leaues as they be here in the moneth of May and Iune. They eate bread of a roote which they call {\itshape Casaui.} There be other rootes like to Turneps, whiche be called {\itshape Aies,} and also {\itshape Batatas,} but the {\itshape Batatas} be bet­ter, and there be fieldes ful of them as be here of sowen fieldes. There is also a fruyte which is called {\itshape Pinas,} whiche be of the makyng of a Pine apple, but they be greater: the trees that beareth them be lyke to the Canes or stockes of Lillies, and {\itshape Flure de Luces.} Whē they be in season they turne yellow like to waxe: the smell of it is so much \& so sweete, y\textsuperscript{t} it smelleth in all y\textsuperscript{e} house where they be. It is of a maruelous goodly sauour although that the tast of it be somwhat egre. There is also an other fruit of trees which is called {\itshape Mameis,} which is as great, \& like to a Doues egge, of a tawny colour, being within three kernels, the meate of it is like to a Peach, somewhat red. The people of this Ilande were Idolaters \& naked, although that now they be turned Christians. The womē do weare a kind of apparel, which they call there {\itshape Naguas,} made in such sorte, that it couereth them from the waste to the knees: and they which be Virgines, go naked as they were borne: \& when any woman hath loste bir Virginitie, immediately she doth couer hir self, and if she haue no {\itshape Naguas,} she putteth before hir a leafe tied on with threedes made of Cotton woll, wherwith she co­uereth hir Secretes, and that leafe they call there {\itshape Pampanillia.} % image:http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5891&page=9
 and when any of these women are with childe, or giue sucke to any childe, there is no man that will company with hir for any thing in the worlde: they say it is sinne to company with hir at that time. And when any woman is with childe, hir husband taketh an other vntill his wife be deliuered of hir childe, and as long as she giueth sucke: and when any man dieth that is of estimation, they did make a greate hole in the ground, where they vsed to put him in, and they put him in sitting: and put in also with him both meate and drynke, and they couer the hole with timber and with earthe, and lefte open a straight mouth, where a man mighte goe in: to these came their wiues, and such as loued them well, and went in to him, and put in meate, and after that they were entered in, the mouth was couered with timber and earth: and so they were lefte all within, and they sayde that they wente to beare him company to the other world, where they should haue bet­ter cheere and more pleasure. And now there is in this Iland many townes of Christians, the principall towne is {\itshape Sancto Domingo,} where is a good porte and ryuer: and likewise there is the best trade of all the Ilande: \& this is towardes the south parte: \& at the north parte is the porte of {\itshape Plata:} but the towne is little, and the porte is not very good: and by this meanes the trade is litle. In this Iland be many moūtaines of Salte, and rockes of Salte. From the cape of Saint {\itshape Nicholas} to the Iland of {\itshape Cuba} are. xiiij leagues: the Iland of {\itshape Cuba} lieth west, it hath in length two hundereth and twentie leagues: and in

It is a good Iland: and in it is much victuall, and much wilde foule, Pigeons, Geese and Partriche, and many Po­pingayes. The countrey is full of Mountaynes, there is ga­thered in it much golde, although that it is not so fine as that of the Iland called {\itshape Espanola.} The people be idolaters, the one parte of it is inhabited with Christians.

Towarde the south parte of {\itshape Cuba,} is the Ilande called {\itshape Iamayca,} and this of {\itshape Iamayca,} lieth weast from the cape of {\itshape Tiburon.} There is from the cape of {\itshape Tiburon,} which is in the Iland of {\itshape Spanola} vnto {\itshape Iamaica.} xx. leagues, and in the middest

And there be a certayne kinde of little beastes, that haue the snoute and tayle like to a Ratte, and the body like to a Coney, and these be called {\itshape Hutias,} whose fleshe is good to eate, and there are multitudes of them. From the ende of the Ilande of {\itshape Cuba} towardes the Northweast, hath appeared a great coun­trie, it is thought to be a firme lande. And seyng that we haue spoken of the Ilandes, lette vs returne to the coast of {\itshape Paria,}

There are from them to the cape twentie leagues, they are in ten degrees. From the cape of saynt {\itshape Roman} vnto the cape of {\itshape Coquibacoa} are three small Ilandes Trianglewyse, betweene these twoo capes is one gulfe of sea in shape foure square, and at the cape of {\itshape Coquibacoa} entereth in frō this gulfe an other little gulfe within the lande foure leagues, and at the

The sande of the riuers is altogether stony sande, of the colour of golde, and it sheweth as though that it were al gold. There are in this Ilande many Hogges, and much Deare. There is found in the powre of the {\itshape Indians,} much gold and coper, and also much gilt Coper. The {\itshape Indians} do say that they gilte the Coper with an hearbe that grow­eth in that countrey, whiche beyng stamped, and the iuyce ta­ken out, and the Coper beyng washed therewith and put to the fire, it turneth to the colour of most fine gold, and it riseth more or lesse in colour, accordyng to the quātitie of the hearbe that is put to it. The people be fearce and warlike, they vse bowes, and their arrowes be little bigger than quarrels, which they annoynt with an hearbe that is so full of poyson, that it is a great chaunce (when they hit any man) if he escape, beyng wounded with that hearbe: one of the things wherewith they make that hearb, are certaine apples which be in that coūtrey,

Before you come to {\itshape Sancta Marta} there is {\itshape Yaharo,} which is in the side of the snowie mountaynes. {\itshape Ya­haro} as a good port and standeth in a good countrey: and there 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Yaharo.} be Orchardes of trees of diuers sortes of fruytes to be eaten, \& among them there is one like to Oringes, \& when the fruite is in season to be eaten it turneth yellow, and the meate that is within it is like to butter: It hath a good sauour, and hath the tast so good \& so soft, that it is maruelous. The moūtaines that lie full of Snow, beginne from {\itshape Sancta Marta:} and neare to {\itshape Yaharo} is the highest parte of them, and they shew vpon the toppes as white as if they were Snowe, and from thence they reache to {\itshape Veneciuela,} and so into the countrey within, it is not

This Mountayne is vpō the toppe playne, and there be many townes of {\itshape Indians} vpō it, and many lakes of standing water. In {\itshape Sancta Marta} is ga­thered much Cotton wooll, and the {\itshape Indians} do make store of clothe of it, whiche is a thing to be seene, and they make it of many colours: they do make of Popingayes fethers, Pecocks and of other birdes which be in that countrey, certaine things like to Diademes, very great, that the gētlewomen do put on their heades, which things hang downe vpon their shoulders in one peece vnto their girdle: like to the ends of a bishops Mi­tre: \& this is so well wrought, that it is maruell to see the di­uersitie of the colours, and the worke, and the arte thereof: and as the colours be naturall and of themselues, they shewe so wel, that no artificiall worke of such as is wrought here, is so good nor so acceptable vnto the sight. From {\itshape Sancta Marta} the coast turneth south .xx. leagues: and in the turnyng cape % image:http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5891&page=12

Then I required thē agayne y\textsuperscript{t} they should do it, \& not doing it, I would make warre agaynst them, \& would take their Towne, \& would kill as many as I tooke, or would keepe thē prisoners, and sell thē for slaues.

At the entrie toward the East he hathe certaine sholdes, which entreth in more thā two leagues into the Sea athwart of the mouth \& entrie, and they goe wel­neere ouer the one halfe of the entrie towards the Weast part of the Gulfe. And there is fiue leagues within the Gulfe, the {\itshape Darien,} whych is inhabited with Christiās, and there they ga­ther fyne golde in a Riuer that descendeth from certaine high Mountaynes. In these Mountaynes be many Tigres \& Ly­ons, and diuers other beastes, and Cattes with lōg tayles, and % image:http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5891&page=14
 be like to Apes, but that they haue great tayles. There are also Swyne, \& many great beastes as great as kyne, fatte, whiche be of a grey couloure, and haue their feete like to kyne, the head like to a Moyle, with long eares, their flesh being good to eate. There be also many other beastes. I toke that Towne, which was the first that was taken in that Countrey, and I saw all these beasts, and it was told me, that they had sene Ownees. I saw none, but I saw a riuer y\textsuperscript{t} passeth by the towne of {\itshape Darien,} wherein were many Lyzards that were great, \& so grose in the body as a Calfe: and if they see any man, dogge, or pigge neere the water, they come out of it, and fall vpon him, and if they catche him, they carrie him into the water, \& eate him. I hap­pened to kill y\textsuperscript{e} first that was killed, \& I saw cast at hym more than tenne Launces, and as they strake vpō him, they reboun­ded, as though they had stricken vpō a Rocke. And after that, a seruant of mine went athwart of hym, and thrust him at one blowe into the middest of his body, and then we killed hym, and being dead and taken on lande, we found that he had vpon his backe from his necke to the tayle a shell that couered hym all, whiche was so strong, that no Launce coulde passe it: and vnder that from the middle of the body downewarde neere to the guttes, he was as other Lyzards are, and by that parte of his body he was thrust in with the Launce. His mouth was three spannes long from the snoute to the lower end of y\textsuperscript{e} teeth: he had in a side two rewes of teeth, the most fierce that I haue seene, or had bin seene by any of them that were with me. He was fleyne \& his flesh was eatē, it was white \& good, \& smelled like to muske, and good in eating. I saw also y\textsuperscript{e} flesh of Tigres \& of Lions.

The Lizardes be ingendred in those egges, and after they make a hole in them, and they come forth of the egges in­to the sandes, and so they goe into the water. The egges be as greate as a Goose egge, and greater. They haue no shelles, but certayne skynnes. They be good to eate, and of a good sauoure, \& euery Lizard doth lay at one tyme lx. or lxx. egges. Lyke­wise there be others called {\itshape Yaguanas,} whiche be great, and lyke

They be of a russet coloure, and somewhat in coloures: these goe into the Mountaines. The sight of them is fearefull, but they hurt no body, by reason they take them a­liue, and kill them with staues. These are good meate, \& theyr fleshe is muche esteemed in that countrey. Their egges be of a good tast. In these Countreys is muche wilde foule of dyuers sorts, which are good flesh. There are abūdance of greene Po­pingeys, and some greate ones of many coloures, red, blewe, blacke, and greene, whiche are faire to beholde. Their fleshe is good and sweete: and others that are as little as grey Spar­rowes, which be greene and faire. In this countrey are greate fishings of good fish: and also there be Date trees that do carry frute as greate as a Doues egge, some yellow, and other of the Rose coloure, but they haue greate stones: their tast is somewhat sharp. In this Countrey are little beastes like to Pigges of a month olde, these haue their feete and heads lyke to a little Horse, with little eares, and they be all couered with a shell from the eares to the tayle, and be like to a Horse coue­red.

And towards the Southweast lieth the Ilande of {\itshape Perles.} There is from the Gulfe to the Ilande tenne leagues.

 and very fyne. I sawe one of the fashion of a little peare, the best and greatest that I haue seene. The entrie of the Gulfe of {\itshape Saint Michaell,} standeth in sixe degrees. From the entrie of the Gulfe of {\itshape Saint Michaell,} the coast lieth West, seauen leagues vnto the Cacike {\itshape Tamao.} The coast lyeth .xxviij. leagues to­ward the Northweast, and by Weast, to the Riuer of {\itshape Tuba­nama.} 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Tamao.} This Riuer of {\itshape Tubanama} hath at the entrie an Ilande 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Tubunama} in triangle, whiche causeth him to haue two mouthes: it is a good Riuer, and a good Countrey, well inhabited, and of much vittayle, and great fishing: there is in it much golde. In this coast the Sea doth ebbe and flowe much. From this Ri­uer to {\itshape Panama} are twenty leagues, and the coast lieth Weast, and there is in the middest the Riuer called {\itshape Chapanere,} and the 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Panama.} Riuer {\itshape Pacora,} whiche are in a good countrey, and where as is 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Pacora.} gold, and the people are good. {\itshape Panama} hath an Iland towards the Sea neere y\textsuperscript{e} land. Frō {\itshape Panama} to the cape of {\itshape Chiru} are .xx. leagues, and the coast lyeth Weast and by South, \& there is 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Chiru.} in y\textsuperscript{e} middest {\itshape Perequete} and {\itshape Tabora.} From {\itshape Chiru} towards the West appeareth a gulfe oblique, in the middest whereof dwel­leth the Cacike {\itshape Paris,} an {\itshape Indian} Gentleman of greate power, and the richest in that coast: and there remayneth in the myd­dest 
	\normalmarginpar
      \marginnote{Paris.} {\itshape Nathan} and {\itshape Estora,} which are good townes. All this coast frō the Gulfe of {\itshape Saint Michaell} to {\itshape Chiru} and {\itshape Paris,} be from sixe to seauen degrees. The countrey is playne and good, and of much vittayle of all sortes, and in all that countrey is muche golde. From {\itshape Paris} lyeth a poynt of the land into the Sea twē ­tie leagues, and being past the poynt, the coast turneth to the Northeast, vntill it come hard to the cape of {\itshape Gracias a Dios,} and all the Countrey is frutefull, and a rich Countrey of gold, whereas are many good townes. In this Countrey they doe compasse about the townes with timber, for feare of Tygres, and Lions, that they come not by night into the houses. From the Gulfe of {\itshape Vraba} \& {\itshape Saint Michaell,} to the end of the cape of {\itshape Gracias Adies,} are two hundred leagues: and all this Coun­trey hathe not in breadth more than thirtie, and where it is % image:http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5891&page=17
 most fourtie leagues, and all are good people and riche, and a fruyteful coūtrey. There they vse no bowes, nor hearbe of poy­son, but Launces and Dartes. And there are in this Sea to­wardes the Southe many Ilandes, where is as muche golde and Pearles, as the {\itshape Indians} doe say. And they say that there is a countrey where the people that doe inhabite it, haue bookes, and do wryte and reade as we doe.\par
Now seyng that we haue spoken of that part that is from the Ilande of {\itshape Fierro,} towardes the Weast, and Northweast, lette vs speake of one peece of lande whiche is in this seconde parte towardes the North, whiche lande is called the lande of {\itshape Labrador.} This lande of {\itshape Labrador} standeth in .lvij. degrees: it standeth Northweast from {\itshape Calizia,} and East and Weast with Scotlande. This lande of {\itshape Labrador} hath towardes the Weast parte of it the countrey of {\itshape Bacallaos,} whiche is a coun­trie of muche fishyng, and a great countrey: and the {\itshape Bocallaos} standeth Weast from {\itshape Galizia,} and parte of them Weast and by Northe, and this countrey hath many portes, and good: Muche of the countrey is inhabited, and there are many Ilandes before it, all inhabited. They say there is in it greate quantitie of Furres, and very fine. The lande of {\itshape Labrador} is towards the North from the {\itshape Acores.} There is from the {\itshape A­cores} to the lande of {\itshape Labrador} three hundreth leagues, and from {\itshape Galizia} to the lande {\itshape Labrador} three hundreth and fiftie.
